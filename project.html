											<h3>Building Machine Learning Based Platform for Searching Exfoliated 2D Flakes</h3>
											Currently, the primary method for acquiring high-quality 2D materials for device construction involves the mechanical exfoliation of bulk crystals, a 
											process that typically consumes significant time due to the need for manual selection and marking by humans. However, thin-layer 2D materials exhibit 
											sensitivity to the absorption and refraction of light, resulting in characteristic colors corresponding to their thickness, which serves as a 
											criterion for human judgment. Therefore, there is significant potential in developing computer vision and machine learning algorithms for the 
											automated identification of 2D flakes by machines. Various previous attempts have been made using neural networks and k-means clustering techniques with
											different complexity and efficiency. To suit our current instrumentation, we have implemented the control and communication between the microscope, camera, and 
											computer system, while simultaneously running an identification algorithm primarily improved from the method detailed in the paper <a href="
											https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2306.14845">arxiv: 2306.14845</a> using scikit-learn clustering techniques. Furthermore, we have designed a user-friendly graphical user 
											interface (GUI) for convenient operation and have successfully applied multi-chip scanning within an impressively short time.

											<h3>Computation of Quasiparticle Interference (QPI) in Kagome Superconductor CsV3Sb5</h3>
											When quasiparticles scatter between the constant energy contours, they generate standing wave modulation in real space, reflecting band structure.
											STM could achieve high energy resolution (even higher than ARPES, about microelectronvolts) of these band structures from QPI. Former successful observation
											has succeeded in BSCCO (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/%2010.1038/nature01496">K. McElroy et al., Nature 422, 592, (2003)</a>) 
											and FeSe (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aal1575">P. O. Sprau et al., Science 357, 75 (2017)</a>) etc.
											Recently, kagome lattice (AV3Sb5, A = K, Cs, Rb) has attracted much attention. But its superconductivity mechanism remains
											unsolved and even confusing with distinctive experimental methods. To probe the symmetry of its superconductivity, we attempt to construct model with V atom's \(d_{x^2-y^2}\) orbits in 3 sublattices.
											With supposed unconventional pairing symmetry (e.g., p, d, f) in nearest neighbor (NN), next nearest neighbor (NNN) and third nearest neighbor (TNN)
											real space pairing, we simulate the QPI signals respectively with the input tight-binding parameter from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.105.L100502">Y. Gu et al, Phys. Rev. B 105, L100502 (2022)</a>,
										    hoping to inspire further STM experiments.

											<h3>Imaging Momentum-space Cooper Pair Formation and Its Competition with Charge Density Wave Gap in Kagome Superconductor</h3>
											Abstract: The superconducting ground state of kagome metals AV3Sb5 (where A stands for K, Rb or Cs) develops from an exotic charge density wave (CDW) 
											state that may break both rotation and time reversal symmetries. However, the specifics of Cooper pairing mechanism, and the nature of coupling 
											between these two states remains elusive, largely due to the lack of momentum-space (k-space) structure of superconducting energy gap \(\Delta_\mathrm{SC} (k)\). 
											By implementing Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (BQPI) imaging, we determine the detailed structure of the multiband energy gaps \(\Delta_\mathrm{SC}^i (k)\) in 
											the pristine CsV3Sb5. We show that while the energy gap on the Sb p-band is approximately 0.5meV, that on the vanadium \(d_{xy/x^2-y^2}\) orbital is 
											highly anisotropic but nodeless, with a minimal value of approximately 0.3meV near the M point. Interestingly, a comparison of \(\Delta_\mathrm{SC}^i (k)\) with the 
											CDW gap \(\Delta_\mathrm{CDW}^i (k)\) obtained by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy immediately reveals a direct k-space competition between these two order 
											parameters, that is, the opening of large (small) CDW gap at a given momentum corresponds to a small (large) superconducting gap. Moreover, when the 
											long-range CDW order is totally suppressed by replacing vanadium with titanium, we find a nearly isotropic energy gap on the both V and Sb bands. 
											This quantitative information will be critical in identifying the microscopic pairing mechanism and its interplay with intertwined electronic orders 
											in this kagome superconductor family.

											<h3>Phase Determination from Topographical Evidence in 3D Quantum Spin Hall Insulator \(\alpha\)-Bi4I4</h3>
											The quantum spin hall insulator (QSHI), also known as a 2D Z2-type topological insulator, has only been verified in a 
											handful of candidates, such as HgTe quantum wells, bismuthene, stanene, graphene, or TMD devices. 
											To utilize 1D helical modes in quantum spin hall insulators, given the complexity and 
											uncertainty of large-scale atomic-thin-layer fabrication, stacking QSHI layers is a desirable path 
											to realize these robust topological channels in steps. However, they are normally difficult to 
											preserve due to detrimental interlayer coupling. In this study, we employ a combination of scanning 
											tunneling microscopy (STM) and first-principles calculations to report the realization and 
											visualization of robust helical edge modes encircling each layer in a 3D QSHI, \(\alpha\)-Bi4I4. This 
											material consists of two quantum spin hall layers with the same spin Chern number in one unit cell. 
											We image the robust helical edge modes encircling each layer along different types of edges, 
											confirming their topological nature. To determine the phase of Bi4I4, apart from transport 
											measurements, we conduct atom-resolved detection on the surface, providing topological evidence for 
											its crystal structure.

											<h3>Precise Manipulation of High Numerical Aperture Ball Lens for Enhanced Sptial Optical Imaging of Moire TMD Devices</h3>
											Optical probe is one of the most spatial sensitive methods for imaging the exciton and band structures of moire sites on twisted TMD devices. However, the resolution is limited by 
											the size of illuminated optical spots in fridges, e.g., ~1 micro in commercial Attocube. To have more precise imaging, we attempt to deliver ball lens, or solid immersion lens, to enhance 
											the optical performance. Due to their high refractive index (\(n\)) nature, their numerical aperture, NA~\(\frac{1}{n}\), could be dramatically increased, which is proportional to the spatial 
											resolution. Besides, the refractive ability to collect light more efficiently (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41377-020-0284-1">A. Bogucki et al., Light Sci. Appl. 9, 48 (2020)</a>) 
											and additional magnification ~\(n\) could offer even more benefits. Experimentally, we succeeded in precisely delivering the ball lens to the center of the channels, creating clear imaging of 
											devices with ~700nm resolution. The robustness has been tested under spectrometers in commercial Montana fridges at 4K. We are pursuing further optical measurements, e.g., full gate-gate mapping, 
											chemical potential detection, MCD probe etc., for realistic tMoTe2 devices. Combined with confocal microscope or excitonic stimulated emission depletion microscopy 
											(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-22437-4_3">J. Dodgson et al, Super-Resolution Microscopy: SIM, STED and Localization Microscopy. in Advanced Microscopy in Mycology (Springer, 
											2015)</a>), we hope to push the limit towards super-resolution and single moire site imaging.

											<h3>Construction of STM-suitable Strain Device for Quantum Materials</h3>
											Single-axis strain, different from hydrostatic pressure, could modulate lattice constants for quantum materials anisotropically.
											Traditionally, it is not easy to construct strain device for STM measurement, limited by the size of sample chamber and sensitivity to 
											electronic noises (i.e., a piezoelectric based strain device is not suitable). To address this problem, we attempt to construct a new category of device, 
											referring to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41563-021-01004-4">C Lin, et al., Nat. Mater. 20, 1093 (2021)</a>'s mechanical approach but modulating our device with
											STM realistic parameters. To visualize the effects of strain, we use strain gauges for measurement. To simulate its effects on real samples,
											we also select CsV3Sb5 as an example by measuring its transport properties under distinctive strain,
											e.g., critical temperature and CDW transition temperature and comparing it with <a href="https://nilab.physics.ucla.edu/">Prof. Ni Ni</a> (UCLA)'s
											results (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.104.144506">T. Qian et al., Phys. Rev. B 104, 144506 (2021)</a>). This project is still ongoing and 
											we hope to do direct STM observation of single-axis strain modulated quantum materials with the device.

											<h3>Exploration of Emerging Quantum Phases through Gate Tuning in Twisted MoTe2 Device</h3>
											As the first system showing fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAHE) (ref: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06289-w">J. Cai et al., Nature 
											622, 63 (2023)</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06452-3">Y. Zeng et al., Nature 622, 69 (2023)</a>, 
											<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06536-0">H. Park et al., Nature 622, 74 (2023)</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.031037">F. Xu et al., 
											Phys. Rev. X 13, 031037 (2023)</a>), tMoTe2 has emerged as one of the most intriguing platforms for the exploration of exotic electron correlations. However, the challenges 
											associated with creating moire patterns and maintaining good electrical contacts present significant obstacles in producing a multitude of devices. In our pursuit, we aim to draw 
											insights from the structural configurations in previous results and introduce variations in the twist angles to investigate the emergence of quantum phases across the entire phase 
											diagram.

											<h3>Higher Order Modulation for Strain Field Analysis beyond Lawler-Fujita Algorithm</h3>
											In real STM measurement, some factors, including piezoelectrical effects and thermal drift, could cause complicated but non-physical errors in
											graphs measured by STM. In these graphs, lattice's periodicity is broken and it is common to see multiple peaks around Bragg points rather than a single peak
											as usual. To address this problem, M. J. Lawler and K. Fujita et al., (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature09169">M. J. Lawler et al., Nature 466, 347 (2010)</a>) introduced
											a former technique in electron microscope here. In short, it subtracts the non-physical long wave signals in k-space and applies compensation from 
											these signals to the original images. As an advance of it,  <a href="https://www.nist.gov/people/daniel-walkup">Dr. Daniel Walkup</a> (NIST)
											succeeded in constructing strain field from this process, but that includes too much non-physical noise. <a href="http://capricorn.bc.edu/wp/zeljkoviclab/">Prof. Illija Zeljkovic</a>
                                            (BC) took an approximation method, simulating background noise as 2nd polynomial form (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20150-y">Z. Ren et al., Nat Commun 12, 10 (2021)</a>).
                                            To have a deeper research of this problem, we modify Dr. Daniel Walkup's algorithms, correct his errors and add higher order simulation of background noise,
											doing comparison of their results. Moreover, we also examine the effects of coarsening length scale in Lawler-Fujita algorithm to 
											find the condition for achieving the best visual effects.

											<h3>Construction of Metal-Semiconductor-Metal Photodetectors</h3>
                                            Self-driven photodetectors with low dark current is critical for industrial applications, including bioimaging and optical communication. But they
											have been verified to be hard to achieve in previous experiments with graphene and black phosphorus. Even if they could, some additional complex
											operation like the construction of heterojunction or electrode fabrication has to be involved. Theoretically, another structure consist of two simple
											asymmetric P-N junctions is proposed to overcome those challenges. Based on previous results of WSe2 using this technique (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.201802954">C. Zhou et al., Adv. Funct. Mater. 28, 1802954 (2018)</a>), we expand
											the experimental condition, constructing WSe2 and ReS2 photodectors. Moreover, we add the single-point illuminated light current mapping, having deeper discussion to investigate the
											cause of light-current response with the structural asymmetry.

											<h3>Simulation of Apparent Resistivity with Complex Building Structure and Underground Ores</h3>
											There is a well-known joke in USTC: The reason why students sometimes cannot measure correct gravity constant in Physics Experiment Teaching
											Center is the gold ore buried underground :D. To solve this long time puzzle, we refer to the apparent resistivity method, which is widely
											used in geophysics. To be precise, it includes setting several electrodes on the ground surface and getting the measured resistivity from the process.
											We consider the contribution to the overall apparent resistivity both from the gold ores (which could cause
											enough deviation to measured gravity constant) and the building of Physics Experiment Teaching Center on the ground. To reduce the overall
											measurement area and enhance the signal intensity, we suggest a geometrical analysis method and further improvements in equipment selection.
